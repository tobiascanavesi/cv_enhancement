About The Team

OpenAI's Human Data Team creates custom data solutions driving groundbreaking research. Our work enhances and evaluates our flagship models and products like ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Sora, and contributes to safety initiatives through collaboration with our Preparedness and Safety Systems teams.

We work with AI trainers to gather specialized data for training and evaluating our models across modalities such as video, audio, text, and tool actions. Our goal is to develop scalable methods, tools, and platforms to generate and evaluate high-quality data from both synthetic sources and human experts in various fields, including mathematics, sciences, creative writing, programming, art, and safety. We leverage OpenAI models to improve and streamline our data collection and quality processes.

We're looking for individuals with strong data science skills, research experience, and a deep understanding of Human-Machine Interaction challenges, especially with novel and highly capable models. The ideal candidate will have experience working with natural language, image, and other types of data, using that knowledge to identify gaps in our processes and determine where data quality interventions would have the most significant impact.

About The Role

As an early member of our data science effort on human data, you will establish the data-driven process for understanding and improving data quality across all dimensions. You should expect to define our north-star metrics and establish source-of-truth dashboards that our researchers and operation managers can use to track progress and make research decisions. Most importantly, you should expect to be a core member of the human data team.

This role is based in our San Francisco HQ. We offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In This Role, You Will

* Embed with the human data team to uncover new ways to improve data quality and throughput
* Define and interpret tests that help answer critical questions about the impact of model, UX changes, and process changes to our data collection pipeline
* Establish a data-driven development culture by driving the definition, tracking, and operationalizing of quality, throughput and diversity metrics
* Develop and socialize dashboards, reports, and other ways of enabling the team and company to answer data questions in a self-serve way
You Might Thrive In This Role If You Have

* 5+ of years experience in a quantitative role navigating highly ambiguous research environments
* Proposed, designed, and run rigorous experiments with clear insights and product recommendations utilizing SQL and Python
* Defined, implemented, and operationalized new feature and product-level metrics from scratch
* Excellent communication skills with a demonstrated ability to communicate with product managers, engineers, and executives alike
* Strategic insights beyond the paradigm of statistical significance testing
You could be an especially great fit if you have:

* Demonstrated prior experience in NLP, large language models, or generative AI
* A strong programming background, with the ability to run simulations and prototype variants
* Experience validating quantitative insights with qualitative methods (e.g. surveys, UXR)
